# Project-ITCS231
apply or develop 3 algorithms in a JAVA project.  The 3 algorithms used in the project should have different complexity or algorithm  analysis based on Big O notation

Read me!

  This readme was written for an ITCS231 Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis. The goal of this project is to research, apply and develop 3 algorithms in a Java project, By 	using algorithms that include Big O notation, must have different complexity.

How to run my project simply runs by just click it to run the program.

Because I already make the whole program by running just click the run button, also you can change any variable and type to try something new.

In case of user or instructor want to see only one result you can comment on another method like this.
  
  	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		BigO big = new BigO();
		
		System.out.println("---Sorting City---");
		big.sortcity(array);
		System.out.println("");
		
		//System.out.print("---Even or Odd number---");
		//big.evenAodd(num);
		
		//System.out.println("");
		//System.out.println("---Sorting number---");
		//big.sort(num);
		
	}
  
  To see the result only Sorting City.
